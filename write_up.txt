eqn.py contains four functions, sameFormat, substraction, addition, and main. The main function prompts the user to enter a mathematical equation. The main function then calls the sameFormat function to convert the inputted equation to one consistent format. The sameFormat function converts all letters in the equation to lowercase and deletes any spaces in the equation. The main function then checks the equation for a ‘=’ or ‘x’. If the equation does not include a ‘=’ or ‘x’, it prints out that the user did not enter a valid equation. The main function then checks the equation for a ‘+’ and ‘-’ sign.
If a ‘+’ and ‘-’ sign are both present, the main function will print out that the user did not enter a valid equation. Then, the main function checks the equation has a ‘+’ sign. If a ‘+’ sign is in the equation, the main function calls the addition sign to calculate the value of x in the inputted equation. Inside of the addition function, the function finds out where the ‘x’ is with respect to the ‘+’ sign and ‘=’ sign. Depending on where the ‘x’ is, the function will find the number values in the inputted equation and solve the mathematical equation. If the equation does not include a ‘+’ sign, the main function will call the subtraction function to calculate the value of x in the inputted equation. Inside of the subtraction function, the function finds out where the ‘x’ is with respect to the ‘-’ and ‘=’ signs. Depending on where the ‘x’ is, the function will find the number values in the inputted equation and solve the mathematical equation. If the main function does not find a ‘+’ or ‘-’ , it will print out that the user did not input a valid equation. The program should be run as:
