# solve_equations
This python file prompts the user to input a mathematical equation.  The program will then solve the equation based on where the 'x' variable lies in the function.  This basic program only allows addition and multiplication with a variable 'x' in the mathematical expression.  How the program runs can be found in the write-up file.
